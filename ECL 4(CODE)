Title
Setting Up MQTT Broker on Raspberry Pi and Reading DHT11 Sensor Data and MQ9 Sensor


Program:

import time
import Adafruit_DHT
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt

# --- Configuration ---
MQTT_BROKER = "localhost"       # Replace with your broker IP
MQTT_PORT = 1883
MQTT_TOPIC = "sensor/data"

DHT_SENSOR = Adafruit_DHT.DHT11
DHT_PIN = 4                     # GPIO4 for DHT11
MQ9_PIN = 17                    # GPIO17 for MQ9 Digital Output

# --- GPIO Setup ---
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(MQ9_PIN, GPIO.IN)

# --- MQTT Setup ---
client = mqtt.Client("RPi_SensorPublisher")

        exit(1)
